## Summer Institute Goals:

- Access potential data sources for social, economic, and non-tidal natural data 
- Asess geographic and temporal distribution of data throughout CB region
- Create scripts to show the testing of new indicators and data sources
- Investigate thresholds for indicators with adequite spatial/temporal resolution
- Evaluate data against thresholds 
- Visualize data in map or graphical format using R 

## Ammended goals:
- Download census tract data using census API wrapper
- Visualize
- Investigate thresholds for grading health throughout CB

## Education Scoring by Census Tract 
### *lower ed level = lower score. is this actually true? student debt!!
```{r map_plot, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = tract_cb_eduscore, aes(geometry=geometry, fill = TrctELS))+
  geom_sf(size = .01)+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", mid = "yellow1", high = "darkgreen", 
                       midpoint = 50, name = "Education Score")
```
## Income Scoring by Census Tract 
### score of 75% = median icnome of US
```{r map_plot2, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = tract, aes(geometry=geometry, fill = incmscr))+
  geom_sf(size = .01)+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", mid = "yellow1", high = "darkgreen", 
                       midpoint = 50, name = "Income Score")
```
## Income Scoring by Census Tract 
### score of 50% = median icnome of US
```{r map_plot3, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = tract, aes(geometry=geometry, fill = incmsRE))+
  geom_sf(size = .01)+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", mid = "yellow1", high = "darkgreen", 
                       midpoint = 50, name = "Income Score RE")
```
