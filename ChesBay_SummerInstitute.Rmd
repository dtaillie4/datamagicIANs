## Summer Institute Goals:

- Access potential data sources for social, economic, and non-tidal natural data 
- Asess geographic and temporal distribution of data throughout CB region
- Create scripts to show the testing of new indicators and data sources
- Investigate thresholds for indicators with adequite spatial/temporal resolution
- Evaluate data against thresholds 
- Visualize data in map or graphical format using R 

## Ammended goals:
- Download census tract data using census API wrapper
- Visualize
- Investigate thresholds for grading health throughout CB

         rescale(tract$income, to=c(0,50),from=c(0,53656)))

## Education Scoring by Census Tract 
### *lower ed level = lower score. is this actually true? student debt!!
```{r, echo = FALSE}

                       midpoint = 50, name = "Education Score")
