## READ ME 

This is the start of a collaborative project for UMCES IAN (University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science's 
Integration and Application Network) employees to work on code for adding social, economic, and non-tidal
indicators to the annual UMCES IAN Chesapeake Bay Report Card. The current Chesapeake Bay Report card includes only tidal 
indicators for natural resources. Our aim is to add information on the social and economic health of the 
people, land, and ecosystems throughout the Chesapeake Bay *Watershed* Region, helping to connect the health 
of fresh waters in New York to the saline waters of Virginia. 

This project involves the downloading, cleaning and assessing of data for the whole of the Chesapeake Bay Region and therefore
is likely to include many test scripts that lead to dead ends of data. The goal here is to show how we explored potential 
data sets, and be able to explain why we did or did not include them in an asssessment of Chesapeake Bay Watershed Health. 


### Collaborators

- Dylan Taillie, UMCES IAN
- Vanessa Vargas-Nguyen, UMCES IAN
- Katie May Laumann, UMCES IAN

### DATA

This project combines natural resources and socioeconomic data.  These data iclude:

- Economic impact to National Parks in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed 
- Visitors to National Parks in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed


## Goals to accomplish by Friday, July 26

Outputs:

- Access potential data sources for social, economic, and non-tidal natural data 
- Asess geographic and temporal distribution of data throughout CB region
- Create scripts to show the testing of new indicators and data sources
- Investigate thresholds for indicators with adequite spatial/temporal resolution
- Evaluate data against thresholds 
- Visualize data in map or graphical format using R
